`Cost Benefit Analysis`

**1. Bar Chart:**

   - **X-axis:**  Product or category (if you have multiple products or data points)
   - **Y-axis:** Profit Margin (%)
   - **Bars:** Each bar represents a product or category, and its height corresponds to the calculated profit margin percentage.

   **Example:**

   ```
   Product A | ██████████ 60%
   Product B | ███████     35%
   Product C | ████████████ 80%
   ---------------------------> Profit Margin (%)
   ```

**2. Pie Chart:**

   - **Slices:**  Represent the different components of the calculation:
      - Costs (as a percentage of benefits)
      - Profit Margin (as a percentage of benefits)
   - **Slice Size:** Proportional to the percentage each component represents.

   **Example:**

   ```
     Costs (40%)
     / \
    /   \
   /     \
  /_______\
  Profit Margin (60%)
   ```

**3. Line Chart (if you have data over time):**

   - **X-axis:** Time period (e.g., months, quarters, years)
   - **Y-axis:** Profit Margin (%)
   - **Line:** The line connects the profit margin data points over time, showing the trend in profit margin.

   **Example:**

   ```
    80% |          *
        |         / \
    60% |        /   \        *
        |       /     \      / \
    40% |      /       \    *   \
        |     *         \  /     \
    20% |____/___________\*_______\______> Time
            Jan  Feb  Mar  Apr  May

`Market Size Estimation`

The expression `population * (targetMarketPercentage / 100)` calculates the **estimated size of your target market**. 

Here's how you can represent this graphically:

**1. Bar Chart (Single Bar):**

   - **X-axis:**  Not really needed for a single bar. You could label it "Target Market" or leave it unlabeled.
   - **Y-axis:** Population Size
   - **Bar:** A single bar representing the estimated target market size. The height of the bar corresponds to the calculated value. 

   **Example:**

   ```
       | ██████████ 2,000,000 (Estimated Target Market)
       |
       ---------------------------> Population Size 
   ```

**2. Pie Chart:**

   - **Slices:** 
     - Target Market: Size proportional to `population * (targetMarketPercentage / 100)`
     - Rest of the Population: Size proportional to the remaining population (i.e., `population - (population * (targetMarketPercentage / 100))`)

   **Example:**

   ```
       Rest of Population (75%)
       / \
      /   \
     /     \
    /_______\
    Target Market (25%)
   ```

**3. Stacked Bar Chart (if you have multiple segments):**

   - If your target market is further divided into segments (e.g., by age, demographics, etc.), you can use a stacked bar chart. 
   - **X-axis:**  Market segment (e.g., Age 18-24, Age 25-34, etc.)
   - **Y-axis:** Population Size
   - **Bars:** Each bar represents a market segment. The bar is divided into two sections:
      - Top section: Represents the portion of the segment that's part of the target market.
      - Bottom section: Represents the portion of the segment that's not in the target market.

   **Example:**

   ```
      | ██████ (Target)  □□□□ (Non-target) |  Age 18-24
      | ██████████ (Target) □□ (Non-target) |  Age 25-34
      | ████████ (Target) □□□ (Non-target) |  Age 35-44
      ---------------------------> Population Size 
   ```
