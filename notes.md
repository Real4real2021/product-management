Calculations for Decision Making Based on Resource Metrics:
Using the resource metrics you track, you can perform various calculations to inform decisions across different aspects of your business:

1. Pricing:

Cost of Goods Sold (COGS): Calculate the total cost of producing one unit of product or delivering one unit of service. This includes raw materials, labor, machine costs, energy consumption, packaging, and a portion of overhead costs.
COGS = Raw Material Cost + Labor Cost + Machine Cost + Energy Cost + Packaging Cost + Allocated Overhead
Markup Pricing: Determine the selling price by adding a desired profit margin to the COGS.
Selling Price = COGS * (1 + Markup Percentage)
Competitive Pricing: Analyze competitor pricing and adjust your pricing strategy to remain competitive while maintaining profitability.
Value-Based Pricing: Consider the perceived value of your product or service to the customer and set a price that reflects that value.
2. Production Planning:

Production Capacity: Calculate the maximum number of units you can produce within a given timeframe, considering available resources (labor, machines, raw materials).
Production Schedule: Develop a production schedule that optimizes resource utilization and minimizes idle time.
Break-Even Analysis: Determine the number of units you need to sell to cover all your costs (fixed and variable).
Break-Even Point (units) = Fixed Costs / (Selling Price per Unit - Variable Cost per Unit)
What-If Analysis: Simulate different production scenarios (e.g., increased demand, material shortages) and analyze their impact on resource allocation and profitability.
3. Inventory Management:

Economic Order Quantity (EOQ): Calculate the optimal order quantity for raw materials to minimize inventory holding costs and ordering costs.
EOQ = √(2DS / H) where D is annual demand, S is ordering cost per order, and H is holding cost per unit per year.
Reorder Point: Determine the inventory level at which you need to place a new order for raw materials to avoid stockouts, considering lead time and demand variability.
Inventory Turnover Ratio: Measure how efficiently you are managing your inventory by calculating the number of times your inventory is sold and replaced over a period.
Inventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory
4. Resource Allocation:

Resource Utilization: Track the utilization rate of each resource (labor, machines) to identify bottlenecks and optimize resource allocation.
Cost per Unit Analysis: Analyze the cost contribution of each resource per unit of product to identify areas for cost reduction.
Capacity Planning: Determine if you need to invest in additional resources (e.g., new machines, hiring more workers) to meet future demand.
Sustainability Analysis: Evaluate the environmental impact of your resource usage (energy, water, waste) and identify opportunities for improvement.
Example Calculations:


some other important metrics you can calculate:

1. Total Cost of Raw Materials:

Calculate the total cost of raw materials by multiplying the quantity of each raw material by its cost per unit and summing up the results for all raw materials.
Formula: Total Raw Material Cost = Σ (Quantity * Cost per Unit)
2. Total Labor Cost:

Calculate the total labor cost by multiplying the hours per unit by the labor cost per hour.
Formula: Total Labor Cost = Hours per Unit * Labor Cost per Hour
3. Total Machine Cost:

Calculate the total machine cost by multiplying the machine hours per unit by the machine cost per hour.
Formula: Total Machine Cost = Machine Hours per Unit * Machine Cost per Hour
4. Total Energy Cost:

Calculate the total energy cost by summing the costs of electricity, fuel, and water usage. You might need to convert the usage to cost based on your utility rates.
Formula: Total Energy Cost = Electricity Cost + Fuel Cost + Water Cost
5. Total Waste Disposal Cost:

This is directly obtained from the "Waste Disposal Cost" input.
6. Total Packaging Cost:

This is directly obtained from the "Packaging Cost" input.
7. Total Transportation Cost:

Calculate the total transportation cost by summing the inbound and outbound transportation costs.
Formula: Total Transportation Cost = Inbound Transportation Cost + Outbound Transportation Cost
8. Total Overhead Cost:

Calculate the total overhead cost by summing the rent & utilities and administrative expenses.
Formula: Total Overhead Cost = Rent & Utilities + Administrative Expenses
9. Total Manufacturing Cost:

Calculate the total manufacturing cost by summing the total cost of raw materials, total labor cost, total machine cost, total energy cost, total waste disposal cost, and total packaging cost.
Formula: Total Manufacturing Cost = Total Raw Material Cost + Total Labor Cost + Total Machine Cost + Total Energy Cost + Total Waste Disposal Cost + Total Packaging Cost
10. Total Cost of Product/Service:

Calculate the total cost of the product or service by summing the total manufacturing cost, total transportation cost, and total overhead cost.
Formula: Total Cost = Total Manufacturing Cost + Total Transportation Cost + Total Overhead Cost
11. Profit Margin:

Calculate the profit margin by subtracting the total cost from the selling price (which you'll need to determine separately) and dividing the result by the selling price.
Formula: Profit Margin = (Selling Price - Total Cost) / Selling Price
12. Return on Investment (ROI):

Calculate the ROI by dividing the profit (Selling Price - Total Cost) by the total investment cost (which you'll need to determine separately).
Formula: ROI = Profit / Total Investment Cost
